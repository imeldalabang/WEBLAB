      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owen was always considered the troublemaker in the family as he was known for brawling and
        troubling
        everyone. Wilson was expelled in tenth grade from St. Mark’s School of Texas. His two brothers were also
        actors in the present day.</p>

      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expelled from St. Mark's School of Texas (Dallas, TX) in the tenth grade, Wilson finished his
        sophomore year at
        Thomas Jefferson School and then headed to a military academy in New Mexico. He then attended the University of
        Texas at Austin, where he met his future mentor and friend, Wes Anderson. They wrote a screenplay, Bottle Rocket
        (1996), and sent it to their family friend, screenwriter L.M. Kit Carson, who sent it to producer Polly Platt,
        who gave it to James L. Brooks, who gave the Texans $5 million to make it into a feature film.</P>

    <h2>PERSONAL LIFE AND CHILDREN</h2>
    <article>
      <h3>PERSONAL LIFE</h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2007, Wilson attempted suicide and was subsequently treated for
        <mark>depression</mark>at
        <mark>St. John's Health Center</mark> and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.A few days after
        his hospitalization, Wilson withdrew from his role in Tropic Thunder, which was produced by and
        co-starred his friend and frequent collaborator <mark>Ben Stiller</mark> and was replaced by
        <em></em>Matthew McConaughey.The incident resulted in much unwanted publicity for Wilson, and he has
        been wary of doing interviews ever since. However, Wilson opened up about his suicide attempt with an
        article with Esquire in 2021, 14 years to the month after the event. Within the article, Wilson
        described how his older brother,<em>Andrew</em>, supported him during his recovery.In January 2011,
        Wilson and his then-girlfriend Jade Duell had a son.[43][44] Wilson and Duell ended their relationship
        later that year. In January 2014, he had a son with Caroline Lindqvist.[45][46][47] He had a third
        child, a daughter, in October 2018 with ex-girlfriend Varunie Vongsvirates.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, his relationships have not succeeded. The star is not married but he has had
        three kids
        from his past relationships. His kids, however, live with their mothers although he does his duty as a
        father in their lives.Owen Wilson may be one of Hollywood's most famous bachelors — but he is also a
        dad. The actor is a father of three children: sons <strong>Ford and Finn,</strong>, and
        daughter<strong>Lyla</strong>. He welcomed his first child, a son named Ford, in January 2011 with
        then-girlfriend Jade Duell.Three years later, in January 2014, Wilson had a second son, Finn, with
        trainer Caroline Lindqvist. In October 2018, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that Wilson also fathered a
        daughter named Lyla with Varunie Vongsvirates.Though Wilson is not in a relationship with any of his
        children's mothers, the actor revealed to Esquire in 2021 that he lives nearby his two sons and everyone
        gets along.</p>
